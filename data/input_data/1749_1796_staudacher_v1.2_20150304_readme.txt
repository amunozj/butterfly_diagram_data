------------------------------------------------------

YYYY    - Year
MM      - Month
DD      - Day (Gregorian)
HH      - Hour (UT)
MI      - Minute (always =00, only for compatibility with other data)
T       - Time flag (0 - inferred to be noon, 1 - exact time given)
L0      - Carrington longitude of disk center
B0      - Latitude of disk center
CMD     - Central meridian distance of spot
LLL.L   - Carrington longitude of spot
BBB.B   - Latitude of spot
M       - Method (almost always = Q, no real meaning, mostly rotational match with
          other days; E = ecliptic used, highly uncertain, T - time of day used
          to assume horizon as a horizontal in the drawing;
          '-' means spotless day, then BBB.B = 99.9)
Q       - Subjective quality (1 - good, 2 - mediocre, 3 - bad, 4 - better don't use)
GRP     - Group name for given day; NOT the same name for the same group on consecutive days
Remarks - Comment on way of determining the solar equator
          HAMILTON - This observation was derived from notes of Armagh observatory and added
          in the Staudacher file.

Note: Sometimes two sets of spots for one day are given, because two methods to
      estimate the solar equator were tried. Choose the one with better Q.
